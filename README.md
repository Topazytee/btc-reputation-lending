# Reputation-Based Lending Protocol Smart Contract

## Overview

The **Reputation-Based Lending Protocol** is a decentralized lending system built on the Stacks blockchain. It implements an under-collateralized lending mechanism using an on-chain reputation scoring model to determine borrower eligibility, loan amounts, collateral requirements, and interest rates. The protocol ensures fairness and trust, rewarding borrowers for responsible behavior while penalizing defaults.

---

## Features

### 1. **Reputation Scoring System**
   - **Dynamic Credit Scores**: Tracks user behavior, including loans taken, repaid, and defaults, adjusting scores based on performance.
   - **Score Range**: From `u50` (minimum) to `u100` (maximum), ensuring nuanced borrower assessments.
   - **Score Adjustments**: Increases for timely repayments and decreases for defaults.

### 2. **Under-Collateralized Loans**
   - Borrowers with higher credit scores require less collateral and receive better interest rates.
   - Loans are associated with a repayment duration, interest rate, and collateral.

### 3. **Loan Lifecycle Management**
   - **Request Loans**: Users can request loans by specifying the amount, collateral, and duration.
   - **Repay Loans**: Borrowers can repay loans partially or in full before the due date.
   - **Loan Defaults**: Admin can mark overdue loans as defaulted, impacting the borrower's credit score.

### 4. **Admin Controls**
   - Protocol owner manages contract-specific actions like marking loans as defaulted.
   - Unauthorized access is prevented with strict ownership checks.

### 5. **Efficiency and Security**
   - Collateral is securely locked in the contract and refunded upon full loan repayment.
   - Interest rates and collateral requirements dynamically adapt to the borrower's reputation.
